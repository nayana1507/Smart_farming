Design a complete React.js frontend UI for a “Smart Farming AI Project”.
This is only the UI layer — no backend, no ML integration, and no auto-detection of location or weather.
All inputs are manual.

Tech stack:
* React.js
* React Router
* Plain CSS or Tailwind CSS
* Functional components with hooks

General UI rules:
* Farmer-friendly design
* Simple forms, large buttons, clear labels
* Green / agriculture-themed color palette
* Responsive layout (desktop + mobile)
* Clean component-based structure

Pages & Requirements:

1. Login Page (/login)
* Split layout
* Left: App name, logo placeholder, short tagline
* Right: Login form with
  - Email or Mobile Number
  - Password
  - Login button
  - “Login as Guest” button
  - Link to Register page
* Basic form validation (empty field check)

2. Register Page (/register)
* Fields:
  - Name
  - Email or Mobile
  - Password
  - Confirm Password
* Register button
* Link back to Login page

3. Dashboard (/dashboard)
* After login, redirect here
* Display 3 clickable cards:
  - Soil Analysis & Irrigation
  - Plant Disease Detection
  - Market Prices
* Each card navigates to its respective page
* Simple welcome message

4. Soil Analysis + Crop + Irrigation Page (/soil-analysis)
This is the main page.

Layout: 3-column layout (or stacked on mobile)

Left column: Input Form
* Upload soil image
* N value (number, optional)
* P value (number, optional)
* K value (number, optional)
* pH value (optional)
* Location (manual text input)
* Time of the year
* “Analyze Soil” button

Middle column: Soil Analysis Result (shown after submit)
* Soil type
* Fertility level
* Soil condition summary

Right column: Recommendations (shown after submit)
* Crop recommendations (top 3–5 with suitability score)
* Irrigation recommendation:
  - Irrigation type
  - Water requirement (low/medium/high)
  - Irrigation frequency

Use dummy/static data to display results after clicking “Analyze Soil”.

5. Plant Disease Detection Page (/disease-detection)
* Upload plant/leaf image
* Crop name dropdown
* “Detect Disease” button
* Display dummy output:
  - Disease name
  - Severity
  - Suggested treatment

6. Market Prices Page (/market-prices)
* Crop name input
* Market location input (manual)
* “Get Prices” button
* Display dummy price table

Navigation:
* Use a Navbar + Sidebar for logged-in pages
* Navbar includes app name and Logout button
* Sidebar includes links to:
  - Dashboard
  - Soil Analysis
  - Disease Detection
  - Market Prices

Code structure:
* Separate components and pages
* Use React Router for navigation
* Clean folder structure (pages, components)
* No authentication logic required — simulate login state

Output:
* Provide complete React component code
* Include basic styling
* App should run without errors
